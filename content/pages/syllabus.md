## Primary Text

Sakurai, J. J. _Modern Quantum Mechanics._ Revised Edition. Addison-Wesley publishers.

## Supplemental Text

Cohen-Tannoudji, C., et al. _Quantum Mechanics._ Vols. 1 and 2. Wiley-Interscience publishers.

## Homework

Homework assignments will be handed out once a week. Problem sets should be returned on the due date (usually a week later). You will get the most out of the course if you make a serious effort to do the assignments completely on your own, consulting with other students and the course staff only when you are seriously stuck. While you may discuss the homework problems with other students, the final writeup must be your own work. There will be some numerical problems assigned as homework. You can use your favorite math package (i.e. Mathematica®, Matlab®, etc.) or programming language (i.e. C, C++, Basic, etc.) to solve these problems. Please include a printout of the input lines or program you use with your problem set writeup.

## Grading

The course grade is based entirely on the homework assignments.
